🚀 Enterprise AI Copilot – Project Story

✨ Inspiration

We noticed that modern enterprises often struggle with fragmented communication and inefficient cross-departmental collaboration. Tasks are spread across tools and teams, creating silos and delays. Inspired by the idea of intelligent orchestration, we set out to build an AI-powered copilot that could coordinate multiple business agents—each handling a specific operational task—to streamline enterprise workflows.

🤖 What it does

Enterprise AI Copilot is a modular multi-agent platform that enables AI to collaborate across enterprise roles. It offers:<br/> 
	•	🧠 Instruction Parsing via Gemini <br/>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;Converts natural language into actionable task lists (e.g. feedback analysis, sentiment monitoring).  
	•	👥 Multi-Agent Task Execution<br/>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Runs different agents like FeedbackAgent and SocialAgent in parallel, each responsible for a domain.  
	•	📊 Report & Chart Generation<br/>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Outputs structured analysis as Word/PDF reports, including sentiment charts and key summaries.  
	•	☁️ Cloud Storage Integration<br/>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Automatically uploads reports and charts to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for persistent access.  
	•	🔐 User Authentication & Role Control <br/> 
       &nbsp; &nbsp;Users can register/login, and access is controlled via JWT tokens with future role-based access planned.

🧱 How we built it <br/>
	•	Backend: FastAPI + async + modular RESTful APIs <br/>
	•	LLM Integration: **Gemini Pro via Vertex AI** for task parsing and summarization<br/>
	•	Agent Architecture: Each agent implements a unified run() interface; compatible with Google ADK<br/>
	•	Reporting: python-docx and reportlab used to generate professional reports with embedded data<br/>
	•	Storage:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** for report/chart hosting<br/>
	•	Deployment: Dockerized and deployed using Cloud Run (fully serverless)<br/>

<hr/>

🚧 Challenges we ran into<br/>
	•	⚙️ Designing a robust and extensible multi-agent orchestration system<br/>
	•	🔄 Prompt engineering Gemini Pro to reliably return JSON task lists<br/>
	•	📎 Integrating LLM summaries, tabular analysis, and charts into cohesive Word/PDF reports<br/>
	•	🧵 Managing concurrent agent execution and asynchronous data flow<br/>
	•	🔐 Navigating GCP permissions and service account configuration for GCS<br/>

🏆 Accomplishments that we’re proud of<br/>
	•	✅ Built a fully working enterprise AI copilot prototype end-to-end<br/>
	•	✅ Successfully fused LLM (Gemini) capabilities with multi-agent logic<br/>
	•	✅ Automated generation of human-readable reports from structured/unstructured data<br/>
	•	✅ Cloud-native integration with GCS and Cloud Run<br/>
	•	✅ Designed a clean architecture modeled after Google ADK for future growth<br/>
