🚀 Enterprise AI Copilot – Project Story

✨ Inspiration

We noticed that modern enterprises often struggle with fragmented communication and inefficient cross-departmental collaboration. Tasks are spread across tools and teams, creating silos and delays. Inspired by the idea of intelligent orchestration, we set out to build an AI-powered copilot that could coordinate multiple business agents—each handling a specific operational task—to streamline enterprise workflows.

🤖 What it does

Enterprise AI Copilot is a modular multi-agent platform that enables AI to collaborate across enterprise roles. It offers:
	•	🧠 Instruction Parsing via Gemini
Converts natural language into actionable task lists (e.g. feedback analysis, sentiment monitoring).
	•	👥 Multi-Agent Task Execution
Runs different agents like FeedbackAgent and SocialAgent in parallel, each responsible for a domain.
	•	📊 Report & Chart Generation
Outputs structured analysis as Word/PDF reports, including sentiment charts and key summaries.
	•	☁️ Cloud Storage Integration
Automatically uploads reports and charts to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for persistent access.
	•	🔐 User Authentication & Role Control
Users can register/login, and access is controlled via JWT tokens with future role-based access planned.

🧱 How we built it
	•	Backend: FastAPI + async + modular RESTful APIs
	•	LLM Integration: Gemini Pro via Vertex AI for task parsing and summarization
	•	Agent Architecture: Each agent implements a unified run() interface; compatible with Google ADK
	•	Reporting: python-docx and reportlab used to generate professional reports with embedded data
	•	Storage: Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for report/chart hosting
	•	Deployment: Dockerized and deployed using Cloud Run (fully serverless)

⸻

🚧 Challenges we ran into
	•	⚙️ Designing a robust and extensible multi-agent orchestration system
	•	🔄 Prompt engineering Gemini Pro to reliably return JSON task lists
	•	📎 Integrating LLM summaries, tabular analysis, and charts into cohesive Word/PDF reports
	•	🧵 Managing concurrent agent execution and asynchronous data flow
	•	🔐 Navigating GCP permissions and service account configuration for GCS

⸻

🏆 Accomplishments that we’re proud of
	•	✅ Built a fully working enterprise AI copilot prototype end-to-end
	•	✅ Successfully fused LLM (Gemini) capabilities with multi-agent logic
	•	✅ Automated generation of human-readable reports from structured/unstructured data
	•	✅ Cloud-native integration with GCS and Cloud Run
	•	✅ Designed a clean architecture modeled after Google ADK for future growth

⸻

📚 What we learned
	•	🧠 Designing composable multi-agent architectures
	•	🧩 Fine-tuning prompts to make LLMs return structured and reliable outputs
	•	📊 Merging data analysis, visualization, and reporting workflows
	•	☁️ Gaining hands-on experience with Vertex AI, GCS, and Cloud Run
	•	🔐 Building secure authentication workflows and role-based access systems
